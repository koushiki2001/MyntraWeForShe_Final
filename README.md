https://github.com/AnikaJagati/Myntra_CustomerDelight/tree/main/PreFinal

The theme we chose to work on is 'CUSTOMER DELIGHT'.
Ensuring a smooth, hassle-free user experience is a key feature for any ecommerce site to succeed. Many a times there may arise a situation where the user may get frustrated by endless search of a particular style they want. This frustration may eventually lead to loss of interest while shopping. Our solution here closes this gap between the user and website to ensure a smooth and a unique experience.
